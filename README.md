# CSS Flexbox and Grid

This is a simple project to practice CSS Flexbox and Grid. The project contains an `index.html` file, a `css` folder with a `style.css` file, and an `images` folder.

## CSS File

The `style.css` file is where you will write your Flexbox and Grid code. Use the following hints to help you get started:

### Flexbox

- Use the `display: flex` property on the container element to create a flex container.
- Use the `flex-direction` property to set the direction of the main axis.
- Use the `justify-content` property to align items along the main axis.
- Use the `align-items` property to align items along the cross axis.
- Use the `flex-wrap` property to control whether items should wrap to a new line.

### Grid

- Use the `display: grid` property on the container element to create a grid container.
- Use the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties to define the size of the grid tracks.
- Use the `grid-template-areas` property to define named grid areas.
- Use the `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties to place items in specific grid cells.
- Use the `grid-gap` property to add space between grid items.

## Challenge - Designing an Image Gallery

### Requirement to meet

1. **Grid Design:** Use Flexbox to create a dynamic grid of images that adapts to the size of the browser window.

2. **Responsiveness:** The gallery should be fully responsive and reorganize itself automatically on smaller screens or mobile devices.

3. **Uniform Spacing:** Ensure there is consistent spacing between the images and rows in the grid.

4. **Hover Effects:** Implement hover effects such as size changes or shading when hovering over the images.

### Technical Requirements:

- Use Flexbox and/or Grid to create the image grid.
- Apply CSS styles to enhance the appearance and spacing.
- Ensure the gallery functions well and looks good on different screen sizes.

### Bonus Points:

- Without JS, add a filtering function so that users can view only specific categories of images (e.g., nature, technology, art, etc.).
- Implement CSS transitions for hover effects on the images.
- Use media queries to further improve responsiveness on mobile devices.

### Evaluation:

Projects will be assessed based on the correct implementation of Flexbox for the grid, the quality of the design, and the responsiveness of the gallery.
