# Images Folder

This folder contains all the images used in the project. To use an image in your HTML code, simply reference the image file name in the `src` attribute of the `img` tag.

For example, if you have an image named `my-image.jpg` in the `images` folder and you want to display it in your HTML code, you would use the following code:

```
<img src="images/my-image.jpg" alt="My Image">
```

Make sure to use the correct file path to the image file.
